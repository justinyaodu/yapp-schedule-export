# [Yapp Schedule Exporter](https://justinyaodu.com/tools/yapp-schedule-exporter)

View [Yapp](https://www.yapp.us/) schedules in a web browser and export events to your personal calendar. Click [here](https://justinyaodu.com/tools/yapp-schedule-exporter/?q=DEMO) for a demo.

## Features

* Open a Yapp app by its ID or URL
* View events grouped by schedule track, then ordered by date
* Export events to your Google Calendar
* Create a schedule export link for a specific app: add `?q=` and your Yapp ID to the end of the URL

## Under the Hood

This project uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) for its responsive UI, and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons. It can be hosted statically, since everything is implemented in client-side JavaScript.

## Possible Improvements

* Support more calendar formats
* Support formatting inside event descriptions
